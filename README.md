# PhenoAlign
PhenoAlign is a tool designed for aligning medical text phenotype information. We integrate the pre-trained language model BERT into a knowledge-based approach. The execution of PhenoAlign entails the following two steps:

1.Download the pre-trained model SimClassifier from https://huggingface.co/YangTaoM/SimClassifier#/.

2.Place the SimClassifier model within the PhenoAlign directory and execute the ../model/reFunctions_align_all.py code.
